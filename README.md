# Phylogenetic-Composer
A website using three.js, the Web Audio API, and the Open Tree of Life to generate music procedurally.

The goal of this project is twofold:
To create an interface between the data from the Open Tree of Life and associated Wikipedia articles
To generate musical information through the interaction with the Phylogenetic Composer interface
